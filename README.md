# MeetiX OS
**MeetiX OS** is an operating system for the intel x86 platform.
The kernel of the system is mostly derived from the **Ghost Kernel** of **Max Schl√ºssel**, in fact, most of the features (at kernel level) are the same, for the moment.
The kernel is called Evangelion and it's written in **C++(11)** (and some assembly) like most of the userspace applications and libraries.
Started three years ago as a joke the system now is a really research project for me and my IT culture.
The sources are released under the GPL3 licence.
